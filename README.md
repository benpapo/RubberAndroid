A cool Processing project for Android coded entirely with APDE

This is my first Processing project. It is a great example for
anyone making their first steps in the Processing language or
in in programming. The code is very clear and ordered and
demonstrates many programming concepts. Especially suited
for beginner to intermediate programmers.

The project was coded entirely using the APDE android application.
APDE can be downloaded from the Play Store. It is a simple IDE
for developing Processing applications. Very fast compiler and
linker.

Among the concepts dealt with during the project are: conditional
statements, mouse interaction, using Processing tables, file input
and output, using Toast, playing a sound file and more.

Feel free to experiment with the code. Have fun.
